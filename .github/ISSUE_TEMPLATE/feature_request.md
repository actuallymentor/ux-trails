## Feature description

I want to be able to do X so that I am able to do Y.

## Describe the user flow

1. user logs in
2. user clicks menu item "generate taco cat"
3. screen appears to configure taco cat
4. when button "generate" is pressed, taco cat generation starts and user is shown loading screen
5. when taco cat is generated, computer starts smelling delicious

## Any alternatives you have considered

I thought about using a monorail cat instead, but that would be too hard to code I think
